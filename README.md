A somewhat simple [Multilayer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) written in Kotlin I did for college.

It has one hidden layer with a configurable amount of neurons. It learns csv data in the `resources` folder, the one to learn can be changed in the `Main` class.

It can either learn until a certain error is reached or if a predefined amount of time has passed. After that a graph of the error function is shown.

I do not intend to work on this project any further. Use it however you like.
